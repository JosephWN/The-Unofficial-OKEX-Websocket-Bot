OKEX is fairly popular amoung Asian countries. But it is less known in regions outside of it. 

OKEX has its official API documentation. But they do not have any sample code that usable.

For quant traders, API connection through an exchange is important. This websocket API is unofficial.But it saves people's work on reading bad English documentation of the official one, plus no need to reinvent the wheels of just getting connections.
